ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Shaik-Sirajuddin , a software developer with a passion for native Android development and Flutter, as well as web3 , full stack development. I am always interested in learning new frameworks and technologies, as well as following the best coding practices and collaborating with the community to develop innovative software applications.

As a Flutter and native Android developer, I have a deep understanding of mobile app development and am passionate about creating robust, user-friendly apps that deliver seamless experiences. I'm also a Web3 developer, with expertise in blockchain technology and decentralized applications.

In addition to my technical skills, I am also skilled in algorithmic problem solving and enjoy participating in programming competitions on platforms like Codeforces. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology degree in Computer Science and Engineering and have been programming for two years.

During my early stages of programming journey , I developed a real-time application for university students to manage their study materials, which provided me with valuable experience in creating efficient and user-friendly applications.( Link : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.puccontent.org ) 


I am now looking forward to contributing to open-source projects to sharpen my skills further and collaborate with other developers to create exceptional software solutions.
